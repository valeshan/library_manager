## Library Manager

This is a small site for a fictitious library that manages a SQL database using Sequelize. It contains patrons, loans and books (each have their own models), and rows for each of these can be added or updated. Books can be checked in/out, and books/patrons have a loan history. 

This project uses a PUG front-end, with Express middelware and SQL data management. 

To have a look at this, after downloading, go into the folder within your CLI and enter 
```npm install``` then,
```nodemon``` ,
and visit ```localhost:3000``` to peruse through the site. 

N.B.
Ignore the copious number of times Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has been checked out, one of the patrons can't seem to get enough of it.
